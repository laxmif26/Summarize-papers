## Project Overview 🌍

The **Summarized Paper Project** aims to utilize machine learning techniques to condense lengthy academic papers into concise summaries. This project addresses the challenge of information overload in academic research, making it easier for researchers and students to grasp essential concepts quickly.

### Key Features:

- **Text Processing**: Cleaning and pre-processing text data from academic papers.
- **Summarization Models**: Implementing models such as BERT, GPT, and other NLP techniques to generate summaries.
- **User Interface**: A simple web interface for users to input text and receive summarized output.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring summary quality through ROUGE scores and user feedback.

The project aims to facilitate faster comprehension of academic research by providing automated summarization tools.
